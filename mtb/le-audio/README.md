# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Bluetooth&reg; LE ISOC Peripheral

This code example showcases the implementation of an Isochronous (ISOC) Peripheral using Bluetooth&reg; Low Energy on the PSOC&trade; Edge E84 MCU with AIROC&trade; CYW55513 Wi-Fi & Bluetooth&reg; combo chip. It sets up a two-way communication data link with a central device through an isochronous channel, allowing for the simultaneous sending and receiving of data.

ISOC is a data transfer mode that guarantees a consistent data transfer rate, making it ideal for applications that require real-time data transmission, such as streaming audio or video, particularly in Bluetooth&reg; Low Energy connections where reliable and efficient data transfer is crucial.

This code example has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.

- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.22 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ Compiler v9.50.2 (`IAR`)
- LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm&reg; v19.1.5 (`LLVM_ARM`)

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
- BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position
- J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position

To verify the output, two PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kits are required: One for Bluetooth&reg; LE ISOC Central and the other for Bluetooth&reg; LE ISOC Peripheral.

Program the [PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Bluetooth&reg; LE ISOC Central](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc-edge-btstack-isoc-central) code example on the second kit.


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

This code example requires you to program the [PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Bluetooth&reg; LE ISOC Central](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc-edge-btstack-isoc-central) application on another PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit to communicate.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe the Bluetooth&reg; stack and application trace messages on the UART terminal connected via KitProg3 COM port <br> 

   Ensure to program the [PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: Bluetooth&reg; LE ISOC Central](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc-edge-btstack-isoc-central) application on the other device by following the steps mentioned in its *README.md* file

   **Figure 1. Log message on peripheral device on application start**

   ![](images/figure1.png)

4. Press the **BTN1** (User Button 1) on the peripheral to start advertising with the name "IFX ISOC". USER LED2 will blink few times on the peripheral device indicating that advertisement has started and stops blinking as the device enters deepsleep mode and logs related to the advertisement is printed as shown in **Figure 2**

   **Figure 2. Log message on peripheral device for advertisement**

   ![](images/figure2.png)

5. Press the **BTN1** (User Button 1) on the central device to start scanning

6. A Bluetooth&reg; LE connection should be established automatically. Verify that USER LED2 on both boards are glowing

7. After the Bluetooth&reg; LE connections are up, the central will establish an isochronous channel with the peripheral. USER LED1 on both the boards should start glowing

   **Figure 3. Log message on peripheral device after LE and ISOC connection is up**

   ![](images/figure3.png)

8. Press the **BTN1** (User Button 1) on the peripheral side to send data to the central. When the central receives the data, it toggles the USER LED1 on the central device

    **Figure 4. Log message on peripheral for data transmission**

   ![](images/figure4.png)

9. Similarly, press the **BTN1** (User Button 1) at the central side to send data to the peripheral. When the peripheral receives the data, it toggles the USER LED1 state of the peripheral device

    **Figure 5. Log message on peripheral device for data reception**

    ![](images/figure5.png)

10. Isochronous channel statistics are printed every 5 seconds on both the sides as shown in **Figure 6**

     **Figure 6. Log message on peripheral device for ISOC statistics**

     ![](images/figure6.png)

     Ideally, the isoc_tx_count on the central side should be equal to the isoc_rx_count of the peripheral device and vice versa. Similarly, the packet sequence number (PSN) should also be equal on both the sides. Note that when a Connection-Oriented Isochronous Stream (CIS) connection is lost, you need to reset both the boards to start over 

11. Long press the **BTN1** (User Button 1) on the peripheral device for 3 seconds to reset the kv-store library, which in turn removes the link keys stored in the non-volatile memory (NVM)

## Resources and settings

This section explains the ModusToolbox&trade; software resources and their configurations as used in this code example. Note that all the configuration explained in this section has already been implemented in the code example.

- **Bluetooth&reg; Configurator:** The Bluetooth&reg; peripheral has a configurator called the “Bluetooth&reg; Configurator” that is used to generate the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database and various Bluetooth&reg; settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*.
